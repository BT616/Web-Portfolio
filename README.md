# Web-Portfolio

https://bt616.github.io/Web-Portfolio/

This is a Web-Portfolio 

I built this web page to showcase my work.
The portfolio Has its own url that is deployed from github. 

It has an "About me" section to describe whose portfolio it is about.
A "Work" section to showcase our work with clickable photos that should direct us to a new webpage.
Not all the photos deploy a url because we dont have that much work to show yet so instead we just have them a placeholders.
The third section is a "contact" info section with links to our email, spotify, and displays our phone number.
In the footer you will see the name of the person who made the site.
